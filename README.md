# COSI131aPA1
This is a programming assignment from my operating systems course. It simulates a basic command line for interacting with a file system.
The skeleton code was already provided, this included the filter class, message class, sequential filter class, and an outline of methods for
the sequential command builder class. All of the filters, the read-eval-print loop, and the code inside the sequential command builder functions
were completed by myself.
